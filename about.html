<p>Michael Bade is a Full Stack Web Developer, with a passion for creativity and making abstract ideas come to life. Before venturing into Software Engineering, he sang opera professionally, took care of armadillos and mice, taught Middle School choir for 4 years, and led several community/church choirs. All of these professional experiences brought new challenges, allowed the opportunity to learn new skill sets, and made him realize the best way to communicate and get people involved as a community is through human connection.</p>

<p>Michael loves creativity, helping others find their inspiration, seeing things come to life, opera, hiking, running, reading, music, and the arts. Musical creativity and integrity makes notes on a page come alive. In a similar way, lines of code bring life to our web browsers and connect all of us together digitally! Let's connect and talk code some time! Feel free to message him on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-bade/) or email (mbadedeveloper@gmail.com). </p>
